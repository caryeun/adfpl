In the folloowing sections, we are going to walk through
i) How private link work to make Azure Data Factory more secured; and
ii) Provide sample ARM tempalte for you to provision an ADF environment that makes use of private link; and
iii) Provide best practices and considerations of implementing it in your production environment.
iv) Provide reference links to Azure certification, in case you want to learn more about Azure Data Factory / Azure Private Linke
