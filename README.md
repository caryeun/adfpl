# How to eliminate Azure Data Factory's public internet exposure using private link

Azure Private Link was made generally available on Feb 2020.  Since then, it made numerous Azure PaaS services more secured.  By eliminating data transfer via the public internet, Azure Private Link help reduce the exposure to cyber security attacks significantly.

Of most PaaS Services, Azure DAta Factory is considered to be 1 of the most important services to be secured. An ADF instance can connect to numerous data sources that might contain sensitive customer information - and the impact of data exposure can be far more serious than any other PaaS service.  Making ADF more secured, therefore, is critical in building a secure data solution on Azure.

In the folloowing sections, we are going to walk through
i) How private link work to make Azure Data Factory more secured; and
ii) Provide sample ARM tempalte for you to provision an ADF environment that makes use of private link; and
iii) Provide reference links to Azure certification, in case you want to learn more about Azure Data Factory / Azure Private Linke

## What is Azure Private Link?
Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network.
Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary.

## What is Azure Data Factory?
Azure Data Factory is the cloud-based ETL and data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale. Using Azure Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores. You can build complex ETL processes that transform data visually with data flows or by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Database.

Azure Data Factory consists of 2 planes: the "control plane" and "data plane".

The "control plane" stores metadata such as pipeline definition and schedule, and provides Data Factory pipelines authoring and monitoring capabilities.  

The "data plane" is a compute infrastructure called Integration Runtime (IR) to provide data integration capabilities.   It connects to "linked service", which are data stores or compute services, to perform "activities", which can be copying data between data stores, running Data Flows, or dispatching transform activities to other Azure services such as HDInsight, Databricks and Azure Machine Learning. 

The below logical diagram illustrates the various components for an Azure Data Factory pipeline.

## How does Private Link makes Data Factory more secure?

### Network diagram - before Private Link for ADF is implemented
Before private link is available, the communication between ADF IR and ADF control plane will have to traverse the public internet, as shown below.

![Azure Data Factory - network diagram - without private link](media/ADF_BeforePrivateLink.png)

In addition, you will have to open several communication channels between the Azure Data Factory and the virtual network:
- adf.azure.com, port 443; and
- \*.{region}.datafactory.azure.net, port 443; and
- \*.servicebus.windows.net, port 443; and
- download.microsoft.com

All of these adding up together are adding up unnessary risk exposure for Azure Data Factory.


I have exported the ARM templates for the above setup to the GitHub link here.  [armtemplates/beforePrivateLink](https://github.com/caryeun/adfpl/tree/main/armtemplates/beforePrivateLink)
In total there are 9 resources for the setup, as shown in the screen catpure below.
![Resource list - before adding private link](media/beforePrivateLink_resourceList.PNG)

### Network diagram - after  Private Link for ADF is implemented
After private link is introduced, you can secure communication between ADF IR and ADF control plane using private link.  The below diagram illustrates how it works.  

![Azure Data Factory - network diagram - with private link](media/ADF_PostPrivateLink.png)

What's more - you donâ€™t need to configure the preceding domain and port in a virtual network - which further reduced your risk exposure.


I have exported the ARM templates for the above setup to the GitHub link here.  [armtemplates/postPrivateLink](https://github.com/caryeun/adfpl/tree/main/armtemplates/postPrivateLink)
You should notice that there are 3 additional resources created for the private link to work.

## How may I set up Private Link for Azure Data Factory, and ensure no public internet is allowed?

You can configure Private Link for Azure Data Factory via the portal UI.  Below screen capture for quick reference. 
![Azure Data Factory - Private Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/media/data-factory-private-link/create-private-endpoint.png)

You can disable public network access to the data factory.  Below screen capture for quick reference.
![Azure Data Factory - Disable public network access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/media/data-factory-private-link/create-private-endpoint.png)


## How to tell if my self-hosted integration runtime is connecting to the private endpoint?
You can verify by checking the DNS resolution of the service endpoint hostname on the integration runtime.  You can get the hostname from the authentication key string in the Azure Data Factory portal, as shown below.
![Azure Data Factory - Integration runtime Authentication Key](media/adfPrivateLinkeServiceEndPoint.png)

If private endpoint is setup, then the DNS resolution on your self hosted integration runtime should show an internal IP address. In the example below, it resolves to 192.168.168.5 which is the intranet address assigned by internal DNS.
